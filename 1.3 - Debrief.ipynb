    "\n",
    "* The goal of reinforcement learning is to learn the optimal policy, dictating an agent's behavior, through trial-and-error learning by interacting with the environment\n",
    "* The environment provides us with a state of the world, and a reward at each time step, and reacts to our chosen actions\n",
    "* In order to find the optimal policy, we try to maximize the expected cumulative reward over time\n",
    "* The best way to do this is to learn what the values of the states are, represented by the expected cumulative future reward from that state\n",
    "* In order to estimate this value best, an agent has to explore its environment\n",
    "* Exploration sacrifices immediate reward for the sake of gaining knowledge to exploit later, maximizing long-term reward\n",
    "* A simple environment to showcase these concepts is the $k$-armed bandit, where only one state exists, in which one of $k$ actions can be chosen at each time step\n",
    "* Rewards for each of the $k$ actions are stochastic, so the agent has to choose each action countless times in order to precisely estimate the rewards\n",
    "* One strategy for trading off exploration and exploitation is the $\\varepsilon$-greedy policy, which chooses a random action with probabililty $\\varepsilon$, and the action with the highest value estimate with probability $1-\\varepsilon$"
