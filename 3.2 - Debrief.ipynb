    "I learned about using Upper Confidence Bound for action selection, and how this approach is of limited usefulness outside the realm of stationary bandit problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, I learned about the Gradient Bandit algorithm, which, instead of estimating action values, updates preferences for each action by estimating the gradient of the expected reward with respect to these preferences. Action selection is done via the $softmax$ function. This is a first look at a more generally useful algorithm, using stochastic gradient descent to improve a policy."
