    "I learned quite a bit about using PyTorch, by example. I got very high-level overview of the process of loading and transforming data, feeding it to a model, and then evaluating it, as well as the process of loading and setting up a model. I also got a look at model zoos, and was able to try out models on different tasks, like a CycleGAN setup, to turn a horse into a zebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, I learned about the Dyna architecture for planning in RL, and how it can be done in a simple, almost trivial manner."
