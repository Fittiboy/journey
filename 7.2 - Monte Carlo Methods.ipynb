    "## Monte Carlo Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "* Monte Carlo prediction is concerned with learning the state-value functions from experience\n",
    "* As the state-value function is the expected return from that state under the policy $\\pi$, it can be approximated by the average of real returns experienced by the agent\n",
    "* Each time the agent enters state $s$ in an episode is called a $visit$\n",
    "* There are methods that update estimates based on every visit, or based on the first visit only\n",
    "* Both converge to $v_\\pi(s)$\n",
    "* The averages are unbiased estimates, and they converge with the standard deviation of the error falling by $1/\\sqrt{n}$\n",
    "* This is true for first-visit MC, but every-visit MC also converges quadratically\n",
    "* As the value estimate for one state does not depend on the estimates of other states, there is no bootstrapping, and therefore no bias"
