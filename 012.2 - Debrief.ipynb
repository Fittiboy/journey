    "I learned a lot about how different parameter settings affect learning on the racetrack environment. I also learned some practical skills when it comes to implementing more general agents that can deal deal with any generic environment. Finally, I learned how importance sampling can be applied to $n$-step methods, by truncating the importance sampling ratio at different points, depending on the algorithm used."
