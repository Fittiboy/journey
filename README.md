# Deep Reinforcement Learning Study Journey

This repository contains my structured learning path for
mastering Deep Reinforcement Learning, from fundamentals
to frontier research topics.

## Learning Path

### Stage 1: Fundamentals
- [x] Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
- [x] Value Functions and Policies
- [x] Dynamic Programming
- [x] Monte Carlo Methods
- [x] Temporal-Difference Learning

### Stage 2: Deep RL Basics
- [x] Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
- [x] Policy Gradient Methods (REINFORCE)
- [ ] Actor-Critic Architectures
- [ ] TRPO, PPO, or other advanced policy gradient methods

### Stage 3: Advanced Topics
- [ ] Sparse Rewards & Exploration
- [ ] Continuous Action Spaces
- [ ] Lifelong Learning
- [ ] Efficient Algorithms
- [ ] Multi-Agent RL
- [ ] Etc.

### Stage 4: Projects
- [ ] Minecraft RL using Project Malmo/MineRL
- [ ] \(Sim-to-Real) Robotics
