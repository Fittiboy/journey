## Learning Path

### Stage 1: Fundamentals
- Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
- Value Functions and Policies
- Dynamic Programming
- Monte Carlo Methods
- Temporal-Difference Learning

### Stage 2: Deep RL Basics
- Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
- Policy Gradient Methods
- Actor-Critic Architectures
- Trust Region Methods (TRPO, PPO)

### Stage 3: Advanced Topics
- Sparse Rewards & Exploration
- Continuous Action Spaces
- Lifelong Learning
- Efficient Algorithms
- Multi-Agent RL

### Stage 4: Projects
- Minecraft RL using Project Malmo/MineRL
- Sim-to-Real Robotics

## Resources

- Sutton & Barto's RL Book
- David Silver's RL Course
- OpenAI Spinning Up
- Research Papers (organized by topic)

## Tools & Frameworks

- PyTorch (primary framework)
- OpenAI Gym / Gymnasium
- Stable-Baselines3
- Custom implementations

## Progress Tracking

Each directory contains:
- `code/`: Implementations and experiments
- `notes/`: Study notes and summaries
- `resources/`: Relevant papers and materials
- Project directories also include `data/`, `models/`, and `results/` for experiments

## Getting Started

1. Start with Stage 1 fundamentals
2. Complete exercises in each section
3. Document learnings in notes/
4. Implement algorithms in code/
5. Progress through stages sequentially
6. Work on projects in parallel with advanced topics
