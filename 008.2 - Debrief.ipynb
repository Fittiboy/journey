    "\n",
    "I learned about Monte Carlo Exploring Starts, which can be impractical in real problems, and how $\\varepsilon$-greedy methods for on-policy prediciton and control are more practical. I also learned how when it comes to off-policy prediction using importance sampling, the weighted importance-sampling estimate has lower variance, and a bias that appears not to be a significant problem in practice. Thus, weighted importance sampling, using the every-visit update rule, is used most often in practice, due to its simplicity and good results."
