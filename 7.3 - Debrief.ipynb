    "Today, I finished the fourth chapter of Sutton & Barto, about dynamic programming, again solving all the exercises along the way and gaining some experience with the methods in practice. I then watched David Silver's lecture on the same topic, and started the fifth chapter of Sutton & Barto, on Monte Carlo methods."

    "\n",
    "I learned about value iteration and generalized policy iteration, of which the previous methods are all special cases. I also learned about the differences between synchronous and asynchronous dynamic programming, and the practical implications of each. Then I found out, not just from the book, but from using the methods myself, that they can be quite fast in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with the fifth chapter of the book, I learned how Monte Carlo methods are used to learn value functions from experience in the real environment, or even from simulated experience, as a model to sample trajectories from is much simpler to implement in practice, than one that models the entire probability distributions over states, actions, and rewards. I learned about the differnce between first-visit and every-visit methods for estimating state-values using Monte Carlo methods."

    "Today's programming went quite a bit smoother than yesterday's. My focus should be on somehow reducing my need for \"perfection,\" meaning I seemingly have standards that are too hight to be practical, as I spend a lot of time, sometimes hours, polishing details that don't matter for the learning task at hand."
