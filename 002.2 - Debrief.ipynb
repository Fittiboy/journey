    "\n",
    "I learned about the incremental implementation of action value estimation, which, instead of calculating the complete average at every step, uses the only previous estimate and the current reward to calculate the average. Then, this was generalized to arbitrary step-sizes, with constant step-sizes being the most commonly used, practical choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the example of a multi-armed bandit with changing values, I could see how a constant step size is able to track these changes, while the true sample average could not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I learned about using optimistic initial values to encourage early exploration, which allows us to set $\\varepsilon=0$, while still approaching the correct action values. This can outperform more realistic estimates using $\\varepsilon$-greedy action selection. This does not help encourage exploration past the beginning, and is therefore not practical in continuing problems."
